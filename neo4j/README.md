# Basic tests

Start Neo4j server (for visual browser):

```bash
$ cd /opt/neo4j
$ ./bin/neo4j start
```

Run Embedded program.

Open browser in 
[http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474)
and connect to `bolt://localhost:7787`

Then, click on the left on `Database Information`,
and select all relationships to see all the nodes.

To get white background,
go to `Browser Settings` and set theme to `Normal` or `Outline`.

Make sure you add labels to nodes,
so that the captions are visualized in the nodes and colours are given to them.
